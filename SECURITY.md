# Security Policy

> [Version en español](./SECURITY.es.md)

We take security seriously. Please follow this policy for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest **minor** releases of each package (e.g., `1.x`, `2.x`). Security fixes may be backported at the maintainers’ discretion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Do NOT** open a public issue.
- Email **[security@quojs.dev](mailto:security@quojs.dev)** with:
  - A description of the issue and impact
  - A minimal reproduction if possible
  - Affected versions and package names
  - Your proposed CVSS score (optional)

You will receive an acknowledgement within **72 hours**.

## Disclosure Process

1. We confirm the issue and determine the scope.
2. We prepare a fix and tests in a private branch.
3. We may coordinate a **coordinated disclosure** date with you.
4. We publish patched releases and a public advisory (GHSA/CVE if applicable), crediting reporters (unless you request anonymity).

## PGP (Optional)

If you prefer encrypted email, ask for our current PGP key via [security@quojs.dev](mailto:security@quojs.dev).

Thank you for helping keep Quo.js and its users safe. ❤️
