# Trademarks

> [Version en español](./TRADEMARKS.es.md)

The names **“Quo.js”**, **“quojs-react”**, and associated logos, wordmarks, and trade dress (collectively, the “Marks”) are trademarks of **Erael Group.** (the “Owner”).

This policy governs fair and permitted use of the Marks in connection with the open-source Quo.js projects.

## Allowed Uses (No Prior Permission)

You may use the Marks **nominatively** (to refer to the Quo.js projects) when all of the following are true:

- The use is **truthful and not misleading**.
- The Marks are used to **refer to or describe** the Quo.js project(s) (e.g., “Plugin for Quo.js”, “Training for quojs-react”).
- The use does **not** suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation by Erael Group.
- You follow the **Branding Guidelines** (below).

Examples of permitted nominative use:
- “Compatible with Quo.js”
- “Workshop: Advanced State Management with quojs-react”

## Prohibited Uses (Require Permission)

You may **not**:

- Use the Marks in your **project, product, company, or domain name** (e.g., `Quo.js-superstore.com`) without written permission.
- Use logos or stylized marks, or modify the Marks in a confusing way.
- Use the Marks to imply **endorsement**, **official status**, or **affiliation**.
- Register trademarks, social media handles, app names, or package names that are **confusingly similar** to the Marks.

## Forks and Distributions

Forks and modified builds must use a **distinct name and branding**. You may say “Fork of Quo.js or “Based on Quo.js in documentation.

## Branding Guidelines

- Use the mark as a **proper noun** with capitalization: “Quo.js”, quojs-react”.
- Do not pluralize or make possessive forms (avoid “Quo.js’s”).
- Keep a **clear space** around logos; do not alter colors/aspect ratio.
