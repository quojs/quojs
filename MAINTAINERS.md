## Release Management

- **Rotation:** Owners rotate the “Release Manager” role per minor release.
- **Duties:** changelog, version bumps, tags, GitHub release notes, npm publish (if applicable).
- **SemVer:** required. Breaking changes need migration notes and (usually) an RFC.

## Becoming a Maintainer

We welcome applications for the **@co-maintainer** and **@react-maint** seats.

**Eligibility (indicative):**
- Sustained, high-quality contributions (code/docs/reviews) to the relevant area.
- Constructive collaboration aligned with the Code of Conduct.
- Familiarity with the project’s architecture and roadmap.

**How to apply:**
1. Open a GitHub Discussion titled **“Maintainer Application: \<role\> – \<your handle\>”**.
2. Include:
   - Your background and timezone
   - Relevant OSS experience / links
   - Areas you’d like to own / improve
   - Availability estimate
3. Get community feedback (lazy consensus for 5 days).
4. A current maintainer (Lead or acting owner) will confirm the appointment per `GOVERNANCE.md`.

**Expectations:**
- Triage issues, review PRs, and help with releases.
- Attend (or async-review) monthly planning notes.
- Adhere to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.

## Inactive / Alumni

Maintainers inactive for ~6 months may be moved to **Alumni** status and can be reinstated later upon request.

## Escalation

If consensus can’t be reached on a technical decision, the **Lead Maintainer** decides (or delegates to the package owner). Governance changes follow RFC.
