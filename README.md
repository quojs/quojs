# Quo.js The state of things, rewritten.

**Quo.js** is a modern, framework-agnostic state management library inspired by
Redux—without the Toolkit bloat. It introduces **channels + events**, **native async middleware
& effects**, and **atomic subscriptions**.

> Works in **browsers and Node**. No DOM assumptions. Suitable for Node 18+, Bun, and Deno
> (with ESM).

> [Spanish version](./README.es.md)

## Status

Quo.js is in **RC stage**. APIs are stable, types are strict, and it’s used in production. Feedback
and PRs welcome.
