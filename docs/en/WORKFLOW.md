# Ongoing Workflow (Independent Versions)

This document describes the ongoing development and release workflow for Quo.js packages using **independent versioning** in a Rush monorepo.

## Day-to-day development

- **Feature/fix branch** off `main`:
  - Example branch names:  
    - `feat(core): ...`  
    - `fix(react): ...`
  - Generate change file(s):
    ```bash
    rush change -v
    ```
    - Pick **patch** for fixes.  
    - Pick **minor** for new features.  
    - Pick **minor** for breaking changes (while `<1.0.0`, treat all breaking changes as minor).
  - Open a PR → merge after review.

## Version & publish cycle

Can be manual or automated in CI:

```bash
rush version --ensure-version-policy
rush publish --publish --apply --target-branch main
```

- Only packages with change files get bumped.  
- Unchanged packages remain at their current version.  

## Breaking changes in `@quojs/core`

- Bump **minor** of core (e.g., `0.2.x → 0.3.0`).  
- Update adapters you validated to:

  ```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@quojs/core": "^0.3.0"
  }
  ```

- Generate change files for those adapters (patch or minor, depending on scope).  
- Publish only the adapters that you’ve verified.  
- **Do not bump adapters you haven’t validated yet**; consumers’ peer checks will protect them.

## Pre-releases

- For risky or experimental work, publish prereleases:
  ```bash
  0.2.0-alpha.0
  ```
  with `--tag next` (to npm) or publish into Verdaccio.  
- Adapters can adopt the new peer range incrementally at their own pace.
